# cool-game-idea
so what if your a rhino or something. you have to escape from this village. yeah its a cool stealth game but the problem is your large. very large.
second idea is if your also a rhino and your in a platformer game. what if you can go in a direction, and you cant change direction or stop until you hit a wall. your aloud to jump though. would make for a cool platformer and puzzle game
what if there was another game where you are in a gladiator arena and you spawn with random weapons. there is like 4 waves of monsters and then a boss. this goes on 3 times and every single time it gets harder and harder. once you win you get like this weird crown thing which you can use to buy cosmetics for like multiplayer. you could also use the crowns to buy better weapon randomizers. also there are different modes. easy would be like 2 waves and a boss, it would drop like 1 crown. medium would do like 6 waves and a boss, you get the idea.
anyways thats it lmao
